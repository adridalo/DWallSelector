# DWallSelector | Adriano D'Alonzo

This application is used to add display walls via IP addresses, and connect to them and interact with through Command Prompt.

## How to use

1. From within the application folder, find the '_DWallSelector.exe' executable and run it (a pop-up will appear asking if you would like to run it (not recognized by Windows so it will deem it as harmful software). Click 'Run' and open the application).
2. Upon opening of the app for the first time, no IP addresses will be present. You can enter and add a new display wall IP address by typing it into the text box and clicking the '+' button.
3. Clicking the '+' button will save the given IP address and can be now be accessed.
4. Click on the IP address you'd like to connect to, and click "Connect" to connect to the IP address. A Command Prompt window should open with a telnet connection to that IP address. You can now interact with the display wall!
5. New display walls can be added even when connected to another one, but you can only connect to one display wall at a time.
6. Closing the Command Prompt window will allow you to connect to another one if you wish.

Note: Make sure that the system you're interacting with is on the same network as the system running the app (your PC), or app will not be happy.
